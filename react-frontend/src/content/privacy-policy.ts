## PRIVACY POLICY

**Effective Date:** 11-1-2025
**Last Updated:** 11-1-2025

### 1. Introduction

Welcome to RevStar Wellness. We value your privacy and are committed to protecting your personal information when you use our RevStar Wellness Navigator app (the "App") or otherwise engage with us. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, disclose, transfer, store and protect your personal data, and your rights in relation to that data.

By accessing or using the App or our services, you consent to the processing of your information in accordance with this Privacy Policy. If you do not agree with the terms here, please do not use the App or provide us your data.

### 2. Who we are

We are RevStar Wellness, an organization whose primary mission is to provide tools, guidance, community and support for individuals on their wellness journey. Our App "RevStar Wellness Navigator" is a core part of that mission.

### 3. What data we collect

We may collect the following types of personal data:

- **Registration / account information:** name, email address, password (hashed), date of birth (optional), contact details.
- **Profile / usage data:** information you provide about yourself and family members, wellness goals, preferences, your reports, app usage metrics (e.g., time in app, features accessed).
- **Health-related / wellness data:** because our target audience includes individuals pursuing wellness goals, we may process health and wellness data (e.g., fitness assessments, nutrition plans, wellness activities, health conditions, progress reports).
- **Device & technical data:** IP address, device identifiers, operating system, app version, crash reports, location (if enabled), cookies or similar technologies.
- **Communications data:** any messages, feedback or support requests you send to us, and any responses we provide.
- **Analytics & aggregated data:** anonymized or pseudonymized data about usage, trends, performance of the App, etc.

### 4. How and why we use your data (Purposes & legal bases)

We use your data for the following purposes:

- To provide and maintain the App and its features (account creation, login, child profile, reports, recommendations, community functions).
- To personalize your experience (tailoring suggestions, remembering preferences, recommending content).
- To analyze usage and improve our services (fix bugs, enhance performance, new feature development).
- To communicate with you (send updates, newsletters, respond to inquiries).
- To comply with legal obligations and enforce our agreements and rights.
- For marketing and promotional purposes (with your consent as required).
- To protect the security and integrity of our systems and users.

Legal bases may include: your consent, performance of our contract with you, legitimate interests (balanced with your rights), and where required by applicable law (e.g., processing of sensitive data may require explicit consent or other legal basis).

### 5. Sensitive data and family member data

Given that the App may involve data about family members, we apply heightened protections. If you provide information about family members, you must ensure you have lawful authority to share their data. We will ask for explicit consent where required.

We treat health-related wellness data as sensitive/personal data requiring extra safeguards.

### 6. Data sharing / disclosure

We may disclose your personal data in the following circumstances:

- With service providers who perform functions on our behalf (e.g., hosting, analytics, email). These parties will be bound by confidentiality and only process data as we direct.
- With our affiliates or subsidiaries, for the purposes described in this Policy.
- Where required by law, regulatory request, court order, or to protect our rights or those of others.
- In connection with a merger, acquisition, sale of business assets, or similar transaction – in which case we will provide notice (or obtain consent if required) and ensure recipients honour appropriate protections.

We will not sell your personal data to third parties for their marketing purposes without your consent, except as permitted by applicable law.

### 7. Cross-border data transfers

Because our services operate globally, your data may be transferred to, stored and processed in jurisdictions outside your country of residence. We will ensure that any such transfers are subject to adequate safeguards (e.g., standard contractual clauses, binding corporate rules, or other legal mechanisms) and comply with applicable data protection laws (e.g., General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) in the EU) and other regional frameworks.

If you are located in a region with special rules (e.g., the European Economic Area, China under the Personal Information Protection Law (PIPL) of China) your rights and our obligations may be higher.

### 8. Data retention

We will retain your personal data for as long as necessary to fulfil the purposes listed above (including for legal, tax or reporting requirements). After that period, we will securely delete, anonymize or aggregate the data so it can no longer identify you.

### 9. Security

We implement appropriate technical and organisational measures to protect your personal data from accidental or unlawful destruction, loss, alteration, unauthorised disclosure, or access. This includes encryption, access controls, regular security reviews and staff training.

However, no system is perfectly secure — while we strive to protect your data, we cannot guarantee absolute security.

### 10. Your rights

Depending on your jurisdiction, you may have the following rights in respect of your personal data:

- **Access:** the right to request a copy of your personal data.
- **Correction:** the right to ask us to correct inaccurate or incomplete data.
- **Deletion/erasure:** the right to ask us to delete your personal data when we no longer have a legitimate reason to keep it.
- **Restriction of processing:** ask us to restrict certain processing of your data.
- **Data portability:** the right to receive your data in a structured, commonly-used format, and transmit it to another controller, if applicable.
- **Withdraw consent:** where the legal basis for processing is your consent, you may withdraw it at any time (which may affect your use of the App).
- **Object to processing:** in some jurisdictions you may object to certain types of processing (e.g., profiling, direct marketing).
- **Lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority:** if you believe we have processed your data unlawfully.

If you are a resident of the European Union or European Economic Area, these rights stem from GDPR. Similarly, local laws in other jurisdictions (for example China's PIPL) provide analogous rights.

### 11. Cookies and tracking technologies

We may use cookies, web beacons, analytics tools and other tracking technologies to analyse aggregate usage, improve site/app performance and deliver content tailored to you. You may be able to disable cookies via your browser or device settings — though doing so may affect the functionality of the App.

### 12. Marketing communications

If you opt in, we may send you newsletters or promotional messages. You may opt out of receiving such communications at any time by using the unsubscribe link or contacting us at the address below.

### 13. Changes to this Privacy Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time (for example, to reflect changes in our practices, legal/regulatory changes or new features). When we do, we will revise the "Last Updated" date above and, where required by law, we will notify you (e.g., by in-app notice or email). We encourage you to review the Policy periodically.

### 14. How to contact us

If you have questions, requests or complaints regarding this Privacy Policy or our data practices, you may contact:

**RevStar Wellness**
Email: support@revstar.com

### 15. Miscellaneous

- You acknowledge that the App and services may be subject to change, and this Privacy Policy covers all versions of our App and services unless otherwise stated.
- If any portion of this Policy is found to be invalid or unenforceable in a specific jurisdiction, that portion will be interpreted to achieve its intent, and the remainder of the Policy remains in full force.
- This Policy is governed by the laws of [insert governing jurisdiction — e.g., State of California, USA] except where overridden by mandatory protections of a user's local jurisdiction.
- If you are accessing our services from outside the governing jurisdiction, you accept that your data may be processed in accordance with this Policy and applicable local law.
